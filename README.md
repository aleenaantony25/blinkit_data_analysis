# Blinkit Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of sales and operational data from **Blinkit**, a prominent quick commerce platform. The primary goal was to uncover key business insights, identify areas for optimization, and derive data-driven recommendations using various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and visualizations.

## Key Features & Analyses

* **Comprehensive Data Handling:**
    * Performed extensive data cleaning and preparation on a dataset comprising **8,523 rows and 12 columns**.
    * Utilized **Pandas** and **NumPy** for efficient data manipulation, ensuring data quality and readiness for analysis.

* **Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Derivation:**
    * Calculated and analyzed critical KPIs to gauge overall business health:
        * [cite_start]**Total Sales:** Overall revenue generated[cite: 8].
        * [cite_start]**Average Sales:** Average revenue per transaction[cite: 9].
        * [cite_start]**Number of Items:** Total count of items sold[cite: 10].
        * [cite_start]**Average Rating:** Average customer satisfaction per item[cite: 11].

* **Detailed Sales & Operational Insights:**
    * Generated a variety of insightful visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to explore diverse aspects of the business:
        * [cite_start]**Total Sales by Fat Content:** Analyzed the impact of item fat content on sales performance[cite: 18].
        * [cite_start]**Total Sales by Item Type:** Identified the sales performance of different product categories (e.g., Fruits, Snack Foods, Dairy)[cite: 22].
        * [cite_start]**Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales:** Compared sales across outlets, segmented by fat content[cite: 26].
        * [cite_start]**Total Sales by Outlet Establishment:** Evaluated how the age of an outlet influences sales[cite: 40].
        * [cite_start]**Sales by Outlet Size:** Analyzed the correlation between outlet size (Small, Medium, High) and total sales[cite: 42].
        * [cite_start]**Sales by Outlet Location:** Assessed the geographic distribution of sales across different tiers/locations[cite: 44].
        * **Sales Performance by Outlet Type:** Compared sales across different outlet formats (e.g., Supermarket Type1, Grocery Store, Supermarket Type2, Supermarket Type3) to understand their efficiency and contribution.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Programming language for all data analysis tasks.
* **Pandas:** For data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array processing.
* **Matplotlib:** For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
* **Seaborn:** For enhancing visualizations and creating aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment used for developing and presenting the analysis.

## Dataset

The analysis was conducted on a dataset containing **8,523 records** and **12 features**. Key features included item details (fat content, type), outlet characteristics (establishment year, type, size, location), sales figures, and customer ratings.
